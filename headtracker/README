== Installation ==
* Install headtracking software:
  - either Facetracknoir and its Plugin-Pack: http://www.facetracknoir.nl/
  - or Opentrack: https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack

* You need to have the headtracker folder somewhere on your system. Its source
  for FlightGear's development version is part of FGAddon, precisely at:

    https://sourceforge.net/p/flightgear/fgaddon/HEAD/tree/trunk/Addons/Headtracker/

* Since FGAddon is a Subversion repository, any method to retrieve contents
  from a Subversion repository should be fine to get Headtracker on your hard
  drive. The page <http://wiki.flightgear.org/FGAddon> explains a bunch of
  them in case you have no idea. For instance, with the Subversion
  command-line client (svn), the following command retrieves the development
  version of Headtracker  (the last parameter is the destination folder):

    svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/flightgear/fgaddon/trunk/Addons/Headtracker Headtracker

== Usage ==
Add the following argument to your fgfs command line:

  --addon=full-path-to-the-headtracker-folder
  For Facetracknoir:
  --generic=socket,in,25,localhost,5550,udp,facetracknoir
  --generic=socket,out,10,localhost,5551,udp,facetracknoir
  For Opentrack:
  --generic=socket,in,25,localhost,5542,udp,opentrack

  Optional (to monitor headtracker values):
  --prop:browser=/sim/headtracker

With Facetracknoir, you can press '=' to reset the view.

This should work in FlightGear 2017.3 and later versions (2017.3 is the first
version having the --addon option).
